/*
   This file is a solution for an issue with compile_protos.sh where for tsproto artifact
   generation, protos outside of the top-level directory (i.e in nested directories) are not
   picked up and are missing from the tsproto package. This is unless they are imported and
   used in a top-level proto like this one.
   The objects in this file are not intended for use, there just needs to be a top-level proto
   referencing a nested proto for those nested protos to be picked up during protobuf CI.
   See this thread for more details:
